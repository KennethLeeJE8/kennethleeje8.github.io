    description: "This project examines whether Spotify's audio features, such as danceability, energy, loudness, and acousticness, can reveal patterns across different music genres. By combining my personal playlists with a dataset of songs across seven genres, I looked for trends that could inform playlist creation and improve music recommendations.",
    fullDescription: "I compared how genres differ in their feature profiles and tested how well these attributes could separate songs into distinct categories. While predicting popularity proved less reliable, the genre patterns were much clearer â€” for example, metal tracks tended to have higher energy and loudness, while blues and indie showed stronger acoustic qualities. These insights suggest ways to make playlist curation and recommendations more tailored to listener preferences. I imported my personal playlists as test/training data.",
